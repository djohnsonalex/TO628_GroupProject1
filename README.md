# TO628_GroupProject1

Assume that your team has been engaged by a hedge fund to identify potential opportunities in the peer to peer lending space. You have decided to deeply explore the Prosper.com marketplace.

Data for the project is available in ProjectA_Listings2013.csv  download. Column headers are self explanatory.

We want to build two models:

A linear regression model to determine how interest rate for loans is determined. Essentially, we are getting an idea of what the market considers “credit risks”. We get a sense of how much interest rate premium is demanded by the market for compensating for a specific credit risk.

A logistic model of what factors lead to a loan default. Essentially we want to check our understanding from the last model. All the items that the last model showed as credit risks leading to compensatory adjustment in interest rate - do those items really cause defaults. Are there other items which cause default but which does not show in Model 1?

Our objective is to identify arbitrage opportunities. Are there elements that the market does not consider a risk factor - but it actually is? Looking in the opposite direction - are there elements that market considers a risk factor but actually it isn’t.

You will need to prepare a report with your findings. The report needs to be in HTML format and should contain  your code, output and analysis. We will place heavy emphasis on communicating your analysis in this report - you would want to pay attention to formatting, structure and look/feel of the report.
